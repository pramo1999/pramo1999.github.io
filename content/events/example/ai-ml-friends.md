summary: Discussing the application of probabilistic machine learning models to the PLIDA dataset.
abstract: 'Traditional mortality models often rely on static demographic factors. In this talk, I present a novel approach using a State-Based Dynamic Probabilistic Model that incorporates individual health status transitions. We discuss the computational challenges of handling the Personal-Level Integrated Data Asset (PLIDA) and how machine learning techniques can uncover non-linear relationships in health trajectories to improve predictive accuracy.'
