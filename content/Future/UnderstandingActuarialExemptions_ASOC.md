<!-- ### Giving Back to the ANU Community

It is a privilege to be invited to participate in the **ASOC "Understanding Exemptions + First Year Panel"** for the second time. As someone who recently completed a 6.5-year journey at ANU, including founding the Sri Lankan Society and working at the Australian Government Actuary (AGA) while studying, I know how daunting those first few semesters can feel.

### Event Details

* **Date**: Thursday, 26th of February 2026
* **Time**: 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm (Panel starts at 3:00 pm)
* **Location**: Allan Barton Forum, CBE, ANU

I look forward to meeting the new cohort and sharing the quote that guided my own journey: *"Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go"*. -->
