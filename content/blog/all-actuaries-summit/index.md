I'm honoured to present my recent work on state-based dynamic probabilistic mortality models at the All Actuaries Summit 2026. The session will cover how national-scale health data can improve individual-level mortality forecasts and the implications for retirement planning and policymaking.

If you'd like to follow up or see the slides after the conference, please check back here or reach out via the contact links on my profile.
