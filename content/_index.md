        My Honours thesis, **"Rethinking Mortality Using a State-Based Dynamic Probabilistic Model,"** focused on improving traditional mortality predictions to support better planning horizons for Australian retirees. 
        
        This research leveraged the **Personal-Level Integrated Data Asset (PLIDA)** to incorporate health-based impacts on mortality and the dynamic nature of individual health status into actuarial forecasting.
